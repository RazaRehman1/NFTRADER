In the basic sense, when you purchase an NFT through the Service you essentially \u201cown\u2019 the NFT you purchase.  But in practice, it is better thought of as purchasing exclusive rights of access to an item, more akin to a license, that provides similar rights as full ownership of a piece of property.  An NFT is essentially a digital certificate of ownership representing the purchase of a digital asset, traceable on a blockchain.  But NFT holders do not have important significant rights to the digital work represented by the NFT, including rights provided under copyright law, such as the right of adaptation or reproduction.  NFT Trader tries its best to describe your rights within this TOS so you can better be informed about your \u201cownership\u201d rights in your NFTs, which are essentially the same as with other NFTs purchased elsewhere.","tosTitle5":"2.
